# CubicBezierCurveJS
Math to make cubic Bezier curves in javascript!

I have been interested in Bezier curves ever since I heard they are used to draw the fishing line in Minecraft, so I decided to learn the cubic Bezier curve function and make a Javascript program with it!

You can edit the four points controlling the curve by clicking and draging them.
